The SimpleCollectible implementation is highly basic, and is only an example.
It lacks:
Not allowing anyone to mint an NFT, so it is not verifiably scarce or random.
A way to upload images to IPFS etc rather than use existing image.


Note: DON'T change the names of mock contracts used from their names in Chainlink Brownie Mix
For now, don't use Counters
